# A very bare minimum WIP code editor

### Completed

1. standard keystroke events - next line, on key, backspace space/tab.
2. text-cursor movement - arrow / mouse
3. text-selection via mouse
4. text-selection edit keystroke events

### On going

1. improve text-cursor click performance
2. find a solution to differentiate btw simple click and selection click right now it's all cloaked up.
3. find a better scalable folder & functions structure.

### Future

1. un-do and re-do stack DS
2. state proxy instead of manually updating variables
3. cover all keystroke events control+back space, keyboard selection etc+
